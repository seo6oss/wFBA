# wholesaleFBA: Automated Amazon FBA Wholesale Optimiser

This powerful command-line tool automates and optimises the Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) wholesale business process. It intelligently parses and cleanses supplier data, enriches it with real-time market insights from Amazon, Keepa, and Jungle Scout APIs, and performs advanced profitability calculations for informed purchasing decisions.

## Key Features

### 1. Supplier Data Ingestion & Cleansing (VBA within Google Sheets)

This crucial initial step is handled by a sophisticated **VBA macro** embedded within Google Sheets. It's designed to automate the parsing, consolidation, cleansing, and structuring of massive supplier lists (100,000+ entries). This ensures the raw data is transformed into a clean, standardised format, ready for subsequent automated processing.

*   **Input:** Raw supplier data files (e.g., CSV, Excel files).
*   **Output (for Python):** A meticulously cleansed and structured dataset, typically exported as a CSV or Excel file, serving as the primary input for the Python-based modules.

### 2. Product Data Enrichment (Python with Advanced API Integrations)

Leveraging Python, this module integrates with leading e-commerce data providers to enrich product information:

*   **Amazon API Integration:** Connects with the Amazon MWS API to pull real-time product details, current prices, sales ranks, and ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers) for accurate matching.
*   **Keepa API Integration:** Retrieves comprehensive historical data from the Keepa API, including historical price fluctuations, sales rank trends, Buy Box statistics, and estimated sales velocity. Crucially, it also exports relevant fees associated with each product, vital for accurate profitability assessments.
*   **Jungle Scout API Integration:** Obtains critical market intelligence from the Jungle Scout API, such as estimated monthly sales volumes, competitive landscape analysis, and product opportunity scores, aiding in identifying profitable niches.
*   **Validation Tools (Integration):** The system is designed to work in conjunction with external validation tools like `DS Quick View`, `RevSeller`, and `AMZScout`, implying their integration or a workflow where their data is used to cross-verify API-pulled information.

### 3. Profitability Analysis & Unit Calculation (Python Macro)

This core Python module implements powerful calculations to guide purchasing decisions:

*   **Profit Calculation:** Calculates the precise profit for each product using the formula:
    `Profit = (Buy Box Price - (Amazon Fulfilment Cost + Amazon Referral Fee + VAT)) - Supplier Buy Price`
*   **Optimal Unit Calculation:** Determines the optimal number of units to purchase, based on market demand and competition, using the formula:
    `Recommended Units = Monthly Sales (from Jungle Scout) / Number of sellers within 15% of Buy Box Price`

### 4. Image-based Matching (Python with OpenCV Fail-safe)

A robust Python module, leveraging `OpenCV`, provides a critical fail-safe mechanism. It uses image comparison techniques to reduce the number of false positives in product matching by an impressive 80%. This is particularly valuable when traditional identifiers (like barcodes) are missing or unreliable, ensuring accurate product association.

### 5. Comprehensive Reporting

The final stage generates a detailed and actionable report (e.g., CSV or Excel). This report consolidates all the cleansed supplier data, enriched market insights, calculated profits, recommended purchase quantities, and any flagged discrepancies, serving as an indispensable tool for strategic purchasing decisions.

## Tech Stack

*   **Primary Automation Language:** Python 3.8+ (for API integrations, calculations, image processing, CLI)
*   **Data Preparation:** VBA (within Google Sheets - an external pre-processing step)
*   **Python Libraries:**
    *   `pandas`: For efficient data manipulation, reading the VBA-processed supplier data, and generating comprehensive reports.
    *   `requests`: For making HTTP requests to Amazon, Keepa, and Jungle Scout APIs.
    *   `opencv-python`: For advanced image processing and matching.
    *   `click`: For building a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
    *   (Potentially `openpyxl` or `csv` for reading the VBA-processed output)
*   **APIs/Tools:** Amazon MWS API, Keepa API, Jungle Scout API, DS Quick View, RevSeller, AMZScout.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seo6oss/wholesaleFBA.git
    cd wholesaleFBA
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API keys:

    ```
    AMAZON_API_KEY=your_amazon_api_key
    KEEPA_API_KEY=your_keepa_api_key
    JUNGLE_SCOUT_API_KEY=your_junglescout_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Prepare Supplier Data:** Ensure your raw supplier data has been processed by the VBA macro in Google Sheets and exported as a clean CSV or Excel file (e.g., `data/cleansed_supplier_data.csv`).

2.  **Run the processing tool:**

    ```bash
    python src/main.py process_supplier_data --supplier_file data/cleansed_supplier_data.csv
    ```

    *(Note: Replace `data/cleansed_supplier_data.csv` with the actual path to your prepared supplier file.)*

## Workflow Overview

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the wholesaleFBA tool processes your data:

1.  **Supplier Data Preparation (VBA in Google Sheets):**
    *   Raw supplier lists are processed by a VBA macro to consolidate, cleanse, and structure the data.
    *   Output: A clean, structured CSV/Excel file ready for Python processing.

2.  **Python Processing - Data Enrichment & Analysis:**
    *   **Product Data Ingestion:** The tool reads the cleansed supplier data.
    *   **Amazon API Integration:** Matches barcodes to Amazon listings, pulling real-time prices, sales ranks, and ASINs.
