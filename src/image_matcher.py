        # --- ACTUAL IMAGE MATCHING IMPLEMENTATION ---
        # In a real scenario, you would load images using cv2.imread() and compare them.
        # This could involve:
        # 1. Image preprocessing (resizing, grayscale conversion).
        # 2. Feature extraction (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB).
        # 3. Feature matching and homography estimation.
        # 4. Perceptual hashing for quick similarity checks.
        #
        # Example (conceptual, requires actual image loading and comparison logic):
        # img1 = cv2.imread(image_path_supplier)
        # img2 = cv2.imread(image_path_amazon)
        # if img1 is None or img2 is None:
        #     click.echo("    Error: Could not load one or both images.")
        #     return False

        #     return False

        # and then filter out rows that don't match.
        #

        # filtered_df = data_frame[data_frame.apply(lambda row: self.match_product_image(
        #     row['supplier_image_path'], row['amazon_image_path']), axis=1)]
